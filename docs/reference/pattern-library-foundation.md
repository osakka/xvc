### Pattern Metrics Tracking
```sql
-- Example metrics schema
CREATE TABLE pattern_usage (
    pattern_id VARCHAR(100),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    user_id VARCHAR(100),
    project_id VARCHAR(100),
    success BOOLEAN,
    time_saved_hours DECIMAL,
    defects_found INTEGER,
    notes TEXT
);

-- Usage analytics
SELECT 
    pattern_id,
    COUNT(*) as usage_count,
    AVG(CASE WHEN success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_rate,
    AVG(time_saved_hours) as avg_time_saved,
    AVG(defects_found) as avg_defects
FROM pattern_usage
GROUP BY pattern_id
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;
```

## Pattern Discovery Process

### Identifying New Patterns
1. **Repetition Recognition**: Same solution used 3+ times
2. **Time Savings**: Demonstrable efficiency gain
3. **Quality Impact**: Improved outcomes

  - Document and test
  - Add to library
```

## Integration with xVC Workflow

### Pattern Selection

    patterns = load_pattern_library()
    
    # Score patterns by relevance
    scores = {}
    for pattern in patterns:
        score = calculate_relevance(requirement, pattern)
        scores[pattern.name] = score
    
    # Return top matches
    return sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
```

### Pattern Application
```yaml
Application Process:
  1. Identify need
  2. Search pattern library
  3. Select best match
  4. Customize template
