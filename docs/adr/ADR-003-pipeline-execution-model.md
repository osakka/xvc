# ADR-003: Pipeline Execution Model

### Status
Proposed

### Context
We need to decide how LLM operations are executed. Options include:
- Direct API calls with callbacks
- Promise-based async execution
- Stream-based processing
- Pipeline/Stage-based execution
- Actor model with message passing

Requirements:
- Support for multi-stage operations
- Error handling and retry
- Progress tracking
- Resource management
- Checkpointing for long operations

### Decision
We will implement a pipeline-based execution model where:
- Each LLM operation is defined as a pipeline document
- Pipelines consist of ordered stages
- Each stage can be a transformer, LLM call, or another pipeline
- Execution is managed by a pipeline engine
- State is checkpointed between stages

Example pipeline:
```json
{
  "_id": "pipeline:code-generation",
  "_type": "pipeline",
  "stages": [
    {"type": "transformer", "ref": "transformer:prepare-context"},
    {"type": "llm", "ref": "integration:claude", "prompt_ref": "prompt:generate"},
    {"type": "transformer", "ref": "transformer:extract-code"},
    {"type": "validator", "ref": "validator:syntax-check"}
  ]
}
```

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Clear execution flow
- Easy to add/remove/reorder stages
- Natural checkpointing boundaries
- Reusable stage components
- Visual representation possible

#### Negative
- More complex than direct calls
- Overhead for simple operations
- Need pipeline engine implementation

#### Neutral
- All operations become pipelines
- Debugging requires pipeline awareness
